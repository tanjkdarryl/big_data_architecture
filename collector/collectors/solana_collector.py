Solana Blockchain Data Collector
Collects blocks and transactions from Solana via RPC

=== 5Vs OF BIG DATA IN THIS MODULE ===

This collector demonstrates multiple Vs of big data:

VOLUME:   Solana generates ~100GB+ of data per month due to its high throughput.
          Each slot can contain thousands of transactions. We sample 50 transactions
          per block for educational purposes.

VELOCITY: Solana produces ~2.5 blocks/second (~400ms per slot) - one of the fastest
          blockchains. This HIGH VELOCITY creates significant data engineering
          challenges for real-time collection and processing.

VARIETY:  Solana uses an account-based model with Proof-of-History timestamps,
          slots vs block heights, and Ed25519 signatures. This is different from
          both Bitcoin (UTXO) and Ethereum (account with EVM).

VERACITY: We validate slot/block_height consistency, check for skipped slots,
          verify transaction statuses, and detect timestamp anomalies.
          See DataValidator integration below.

VALUE:    The collected data enables analysis of network health (skipped slots),
          transaction success rates, fee trends, and throughput patterns.

=== EDUCATIONAL OVERVIEW ===

Solana is a high-throughput blockchain using Proof-of-Stake combined with
Proof-of-History (PoH). It can process thousands of transactions per second
(theoretical max ~65,000 TPS) compared to ~15 for Ethereum and ~7 for Bitcoin.

Key Concepts Demonstrated:
- JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol interaction
- Slots vs Block Height (Solana's unique terminology)
- Transaction signatures instead of hashes
- Lamports: Solana's smallest unit (1 SOL = 10^9 Lamports)
- High-throughput blockchain data collection challenges

Slots vs Blocks:
- Slot: A time window (~400ms) when a designated leader can produce a block
- Not every slot has a block (leader might miss their slot or be offline)
- Block height: Count of successful blocks (may skip slot numbers)
- Example: Slots 100, 101, 103 might exist while slot 102 was skipped

Why Solana is Fast:
1. Proof-of-History: Cryptographic timestamp creates ordering before consensus,
   reducing the communication overhead between validators
2. Parallel transaction processing: Transactions that don't touch the same
   accounts can execute in parallel (unlike sequential EVM execution)
3. Gulf Stream: Forwards transactions to expected leaders before they're needed
4. Turbine: Block propagation protocol that breaks data into smaller pieces
5. Pipelining: Different stages of block processing happen simultaneously
