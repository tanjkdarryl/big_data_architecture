## Getting Started

### Exercise 1: System Verification

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the multi-container architecture
- Verify all services are running correctly
- Learn to check service logs

**Instructions:**

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd blockchain-ingestion
   ```

2. Check that all containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

3. Verify ClickHouse is responding:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec clickhouse clickhouse-client \
     --password clickhouse_password \
     --query "SELECT 'ClickHouse is working!' as message"
   ```

4. Check the collector API health:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

5. Open the dashboard in your browser: http://localhost:3001

**Questions to Consider:**
- What happens if you stop the ClickHouse container? Try `docker compose stop clickhouse` and observe the error messages.
- Why do we have three separate containers instead of one monolithic application?
- How do containers communicate with each other? (Hint: check `docker-compose.yml`)

---

### Exercise 2: Start Your First Collection

**Learning Objectives:**
- Start and stop data collection
- Observe real-time data ingestion
- Understand collection status indicators

**Instructions:**

1. Open the dashboard at http://localhost:3001

2. Observe the initial state:
   - Status should show "Stopped" (red indicator)
   - Total Records might be 0 or show data from previous sessions
   - Charts may be empty

3. Click the **"Start Collection"** button

4. Watch the dashboard update (auto-refreshes every 5 seconds):
   - Status changes to "Running" (green indicator)
   - Record counts begin increasing
   - Charts start showing data points

5. Wait 2-3 minutes to collect some data

6. Click **"Stop Collection"**

7. Verify data was collected by running:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec clickhouse clickhouse-client \
     --password clickhouse_password \
     --database blockchain_data \
     --query "SELECT count() FROM bitcoin_blocks"
   ```

   **Expected Output:** A number greater than 0 (e.g., `15` after 2-3 minutes)

**Questions to Consider:**
- Why does Solana collect more transactions per block than Bitcoin?
- What happens when you hit the safety limits (10 minutes or 5GB)?
- Why might the record count increase unevenly across blockchains?

---

### Exercise 3: Explore the Dashboard

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand dashboard components
- Interpret collection metrics
- Identify performance characteristics of each blockchain

**Instructions:**

1. Start collection if not already running

2. Observe the **Collection Status** section:
   - What does "Safety Limits: 10min / 5GB" mean?
   - Why might we need safety limits in an educational environment?

3. Review the **7 Metric Cards:**
   - Total Records - aggregate count
   - Data Size - compressed storage
   - Ingestion Rate - records per second being collected
   - Bitcoin Blocks
   - Bitcoin Transactions
   - Solana Blocks
   - Solana Transactions

4. Watch the **Ingestion Rate:**
   - When collection is running, this shows live throughput
   - Updates every 5 seconds
   - Calculate expected rate: total_records / elapsed_seconds
   - Compare manual calculation with dashboard display

5. Watch the **Records by Blockchain Source** chart:
   - Which blockchain shows the most transactions?
   - Is the ratio between blocks and transactions different for each chain?

6. Examine the **Collection Performance** section:
   - Which blockchain has the fastest collection duration?
   - Which has the slowest? Why might that be?

7. Check the **Storage Details** section:
   - What is the compression ratio showing?
   - Why is blockchain data highly compressible?

**Questions to Consider:**
- Why does Solana show "success" and "failed" transaction statuses while others don't?
- What causes collection duration variations?
- Why is the compression ratio important for big data applications?

---

## SQL Exploration

### Exercise 4: Basic Block Queries

**Learning Objectives:**
- Query blockchain data using SQL
- Understand block structure differences across chains
- Practice basic SELECT, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses

**Instructions:**

1. **Open a new terminal window** (keep dashboard open in browser)

2. **Connect to ClickHouse interactive SQL client**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec clickhouse clickhouse-client \
     --password clickhouse_password \
     --database blockchain_data
   ```

   **What this command does:**
   - `docker compose exec clickhouse`: Execute command inside the ClickHouse container
   - `clickhouse-client`: Start interactive SQL client (similar to `psql` for PostgreSQL)
   - `--password clickhouse_password`: Authenticate (password defined in .env file)
   - `--database blockchain_data`: Connect to our blockchain database

3. **You should see a prompt**:
   ```
   clickhouse :)
   ```
   This means you're connected! The smiley face is ClickHouse's CLI prompt.

4. **Test the connection**:
   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

   **Expected output** (6 tables): <!-- was 8 tables with Ethereum -->
   ```
   bitcoin_blocks
   bitcoin_transactions
   collection_metrics
   collection_state
   data_quality
   <!-- ETHEREUM: Commented out - uncomment when re-enabling Ethereum
   ethereum_blocks
   ethereum_transactions
   -->
   solana_blocks
   solana_transactions
   ```

   If you see 6 tables (or 7 with data_quality), you're ready to query!

5. **Try your first query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT count() FROM solana_transactions;
   ```

   **Expected**: A number > 0 if you've run collection (e.g., 450).
   If 0, start collection in the dashboard first (Exercise 2).

6. **Exit when done**:
   ```sql
   EXIT;
   ```
   or press `Ctrl+D`

7. Run the following queries from **SAMPLE_QUERIES.md**:
   - "View Recent Bitcoin Blocks" - Shows latest block data
   - "View Recent Solana Blocks" - Shows latest slot/block data
   - Compare block structures using cross-chain comparison queries

Alternatively, experiment with your own queries to explore block structures.

**Questions to Consider:**
- Why does Bitcoin use Proof-of-Work (nonce) while Solana uses Proof-of-History?
- What does `slot - parent_slot` tell us about Solana block production?
- Why do blockchains have different block identifiers (block_height vs slot)?

---

### Exercise 5: Transaction Analysis

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze transaction data patterns
- Understand fee structures across blockchains
- Practice aggregation queries (COUNT, AVG, SUM)

**Instructions:**

Run the following queries from **SAMPLE_QUERIES.md - Aggregation Queries**:
1. "Bitcoin Transaction Fee Statistics" - Analyzes min/max/avg/median fees
2. "Check Solana Transaction Status Distribution" - Shows success vs failed transactions

Try modifying these queries to answer additional questions like:
- What's the average number of inputs/outputs per Bitcoin transaction?
- What percentage of Solana transactions fail?

**Questions to Consider:**
- Why might some Solana transactions fail?
- How would you convert Satoshis to BTC? (Hint: divide by 100,000,000)
- What do the input_count and output_count patterns tell you about Bitcoin's UTXO model?

---

### Exercise 6: Cross-Chain Comparisons

**Learning Objectives:**
- Compare blockchain characteristics using SQL
- Understand throughput and fee differences
- Practice UNION ALL for multi-table queries

**Instructions:**

Run the following queries from **SAMPLE_QUERIES.md - Cross-Chain Comparisons**:
1. "Average Transactions Per Block by Blockchain"
2. "Block Production Rate Comparison"
3. "Transaction Throughput Comparison"

These queries demonstrate how to use UNION ALL to compare metrics across Bitcoin and Solana.

**Questions to Consider:**
- Why does Bitcoin show fewer transactions per block than actual?
- Which chain appears to have the highest throughput based on your data?
- What would you need to fairly compare transaction fees in USD?

---

## Data Analysis

### Exercise 7: Time-Series Analysis

**Learning Objectives:**
- Perform time-based aggregations
- Use ClickHouse time functions (toStartOfMinute, toStartOfHour)
- Identify trends in blockchain data

**Instructions:**

Run the following queries from **SAMPLE_QUERIES.md - Time-Series Analysis**:
1. "Bitcoin Transaction Volume by Day" - Shows daily transaction patterns
2. "Solana Success Rate Over Time" - Tracks hourly success rates

Also explore collection performance using queries from the "Advanced Analytics" section:
- "Collection Metrics Summary" - Analyzes collection performance by source

Try modifying these queries to:
- Group by different time intervals (minute, hour, day, week)
- Calculate moving averages or trends
- Identify peak activity periods

**Questions to Consider:**
- Why might gas utilization vary between blocks?
- What patterns do you see in collection performance?
- How would you detect anomalies in the data?

---

### Exercise 8: Storage and Compression

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand ClickHouse storage internals
- Analyze compression effectiveness
- Query system tables for metadata

**Instructions:**

1. View storage details for all tables:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       table,
       formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) as uncompressed,
       formatReadableSize(sum(bytes_on_disk)) as compressed,
       round((1 - sum(bytes_on_disk) / sum(bytes)) * 100, 2) as compression_pct,
       sum(rows) as total_rows
   FROM system.parts
   WHERE database = 'blockchain_data' AND active = 1
   GROUP BY table
   ORDER BY sum(bytes) DESC;
   ```

   **Expected Output (format):**
   ```
   ┌─table──────────────────┬─uncompressed─┬─compressed─┬─compression_pct─┬─total_rows─┐
   │ solana_transactions    │ 2.50 MiB     │ 350.00 KiB │           86.33 │      13400 │
   │ bitcoin_transactions   │ 150.00 KiB   │  25.00 KiB │           83.33 │          1 │
   │ solana_blocks          │ 120.00 KiB   │  20.00 KiB │           83.33 │        274 │
   │ bitcoin_blocks         │  45.00 KiB   │   8.00 KiB │           82.22 │         13 │
   └────────────────────────┴──────────────┴────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────┘
   ```

2. View partition information:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       table,
       partition,
       count() as parts,
       sum(rows) as rows,
       formatReadableSize(sum(bytes_on_disk)) as size
   FROM system.parts
   WHERE database = 'blockchain_data' AND active = 1
   GROUP BY table, partition
   ORDER BY table, partition;
   ```

3. Analyze column-level compression:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       table,
       column,
       formatReadableSize(sum(column_bytes_on_disk)) as compressed_size,
       formatReadableSize(sum(column_data_uncompressed_bytes)) as uncompressed_size
   FROM system.parts_columns
   WHERE database = 'blockchain_data' AND active = 1
   GROUP BY table, column
   ORDER BY table, sum(column_data_uncompressed_bytes) DESC;
   ```

4. Understand why blockchain data compresses well:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       uniq(block_hash) as unique_hashes,
       uniq(slot) as unique_slots,
       count() as total_rows,
       round(uniq(status) * 100.0 / count(), 2) as status_cardinality_pct
   FROM solana_transactions;
   ```

**Questions to Consider:**
- Which table has the best compression ratio? Why?
- What does the partition column (YYYYMM format) represent?
- Why does low cardinality (few unique values) improve compression?

---

### Exercise 9: Performance Metrics

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze collection performance
- Identify errors and their causes
- Calculate throughput metrics

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate overall collection statistics:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       source,
       count() as collection_events,
       sum(records_collected) as total_records,
       round(avg(records_collected), 2) as avg_records_per_event,
       round(avg(collection_duration_ms), 2) as avg_duration_ms,
       sum(error_count) as total_errors,
       round(sum(error_count) * 100.0 / count(), 2) as error_rate_pct
   FROM collection_metrics
   GROUP BY source;
   ```

2. Find collection errors (if any):
   ```sql
   SELECT
       metric_time,
       source,
       error_message
   FROM collection_metrics
   WHERE error_count > 0
   ORDER BY metric_time DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. Calculate overall events per second:
   ```sql
   WITH
       (SELECT min(metric_time) FROM collection_metrics) as start_time,
       (SELECT max(metric_time) FROM collection_metrics) as end_time,
       (SELECT sum(records_collected) FROM collection_metrics) as total_records
   SELECT
       total_records,
       dateDiff('second', start_time, end_time) as duration_seconds,
       round(total_records / dateDiff('second', start_time, end_time), 2) as events_per_second;
   ```

4. Identify slow collection cycles:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       metric_time,
       source,
       collection_duration_ms,
       records_collected
   FROM collection_metrics
   WHERE collection_duration_ms > 1000
   ORDER BY collection_duration_ms DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

**Questions to Consider:**
- What causes collection errors?
- How does the collection interval (5 seconds default) affect throughput?
- What might be the bottleneck: API rate limits or database insertion?

**Extension:**
Compare your manual SQL calculation with the dashboard's built-in "Ingestion Rate" metric:
- Open http://localhost:3001
- Observe the "Ingestion Rate" card
- It should match your SQL calculation: `records_collected / elapsed_seconds`

## The 5Vs of Big Data

These exercises help you understand the 5Vs framework through hands-on exploration of your collected data.

### Exercise 10: Understanding Volume

**Learning Objectives:**
- Quantify data volume in the system
- Understand compression ratios and storage efficiency
- Project storage requirements for production scale

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate total data volume collected:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       'Bitcoin Blocks' as table_name,
       count() as row_count,
       formatReadableSize(sum(length(block_hash) + length(merkle_root) +
                              length(previous_block_hash))) as estimated_string_size
   FROM bitcoin_blocks
   UNION ALL
   SELECT
       'Solana Blocks',
       count(),
       formatReadableSize(sum(length(block_hash) + length(previous_block_hash)))
   FROM solana_blocks
   UNION ALL
   SELECT
       'Bitcoin Transactions',
       count(),
       formatReadableSize(sum(length(tx_hash) + length(block_hash)))
   FROM bitcoin_transactions
   UNION ALL
   SELECT
       'Solana Transactions',
       count(),
       formatReadableSize(sum(length(signature) + length(block_hash)))
   FROM solana_transactions;
   ```

2. Analyze compression effectiveness:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       table,
       sum(rows) as total_rows,
       formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) as uncompressed,
       formatReadableSize(sum(bytes_on_disk)) as compressed,
       round(sum(bytes) / sum(bytes_on_disk), 2) as compression_ratio
   FROM system.parts
   WHERE database = 'blockchain_data' AND active = 1
   GROUP BY table
   ORDER BY sum(bytes) DESC;
   ```

3. Project storage needs: If Bitcoin's full blockchain is ~500GB and Solana grows ~100GB/month, estimate how much compressed storage you'd need for 1 year of full chain data.

**Questions to Consider:**
- Why does blockchain data compress so well?
- How does partitioning help manage volume?
- What happens when volume exceeds available storage?

---

### Exercise 11: Measuring Velocity

**Learning Objectives:**
- Measure data generation rates across chains
- Understand collection throughput
- Compare high-velocity vs low-velocity data sources

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate block production rates:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       'Bitcoin' as chain,
       count() as blocks,
       min(timestamp) as first_block,
       max(timestamp) as last_block,
       dateDiff('minute', min(timestamp), max(timestamp)) as minutes_spanned,
       round(count() * 60.0 / dateDiff('minute', min(timestamp), max(timestamp)), 2) as blocks_per_hour
   FROM bitcoin_blocks
   WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
   UNION ALL
   SELECT
       'Solana',
       count(),
       min(timestamp),
       max(timestamp),
       dateDiff('minute', min(timestamp), max(timestamp)),
       round(count() * 60.0 / dateDiff('minute', min(timestamp), max(timestamp)), 2)
   FROM solana_blocks
   WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
   ```

2. Measure transaction velocity:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       source,
       count() as transactions,
       round(count() / 60.0, 2) as tx_per_second
   FROM (
       SELECT 'bitcoin' as source, timestamp FROM bitcoin_transactions
       WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 1 MINUTE
       UNION ALL
       SELECT 'solana', timestamp FROM solana_transactions
       WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 1 MINUTE
   )
   GROUP BY source;
   ```

3. Analyze collection performance:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       source,
       round(avg(collection_duration_ms), 2) as avg_duration_ms,
       round(avg(records_collected), 2) as avg_records,
       round(avg(records_collected) * 1000.0 / avg(collection_duration_ms), 2) as records_per_second
   FROM collection_metrics
   WHERE metric_time > now() - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE
   GROUP BY source;
   ```

**Dashboard Integration:**
The "Ingestion Rate" metric card on the dashboard provides this calculation in real-time without needing to run SQL queries. It's calculated by the collector API and displayed automatically.

**Questions to Consider:**
- Which blockchain generates data faster?
- How does velocity affect your collection strategy?
- What would happen if Solana's velocity doubled?

### Exercise 12: Exploring Variety

**Learning Objectives:**
- Compare data structures across blockchains
- Understand schema differences
- Appreciate the challenge of data normalization

**Instructions:**

1. Compare block structures:
   ```sql
   -- Bitcoin block structure
   DESCRIBE bitcoin_blocks;

   -- Solana block structure
   DESCRIBE solana_blocks;
   ```

2. Identify unique fields per chain:
   ```sql
   -- Bitcoin-specific: merkle_root, nonce, difficulty (PoW)
   SELECT
       'Bitcoin' as chain,
       avg(difficulty) as avg_difficulty,
       max(nonce) as max_nonce,
       count(DISTINCT merkle_root) as unique_merkle_roots
   FROM bitcoin_blocks;

   -- Solana-specific: slot, parent_slot, skipped slots
   SELECT
       'Solana' as chain,
       avg(slot - parent_slot - 1) as avg_skipped_slots,
       max(slot - block_height) as total_skipped_slots,
       count() as total_blocks
   FROM solana_blocks;
   ```

3. Compare transaction models:
   ```sql
   -- Bitcoin UTXO model (inputs/outputs)
   SELECT
       'Bitcoin' as chain,
       round(avg(input_count), 2) as avg_inputs,
       round(avg(output_count), 2) as avg_outputs,
       round(avg(fee), 2) as avg_fee_satoshis
   FROM bitcoin_transactions;

   -- Solana signature model (success/failed)
   SELECT
       'Solana' as chain,
       countIf(status = 'success') as successful,
       countIf(status = 'failed') as failed,
       round(avg(fee), 2) as avg_fee_lamports
   FROM solana_transactions;
   ```

**Questions to Consider:**
- Why does Bitcoin have merkle_root but Solana doesn't?
- What does the UTXO model tell us that Solana's model doesn't?
<!-- ETHEREUM: Commented out - uncomment when re-enabling Ethereum
- How would you add Ethereum data with gas and Wei to this schema?
-->

### Exercise 13: Veracity and Data Quality

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand data quality dimensions
- Query the data quality table
- Identify and investigate quality issues

**Instructions:**

1. Check overall data quality:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       source,
       record_type,
       quality_level,
       count() as occurrences,
       round(avg(quality_score), 3) as avg_quality_score
   FROM data_quality
   GROUP BY source, record_type, quality_level
   ORDER BY source, record_type, quality_level;
   ```

2. Find specific quality issues:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       detected_at,
       source,
       record_type,
       record_id,
       issues,
       warnings
   FROM data_quality
   WHERE issue_count > 0
   ORDER BY detected_at DESC
   LIMIT 20;
   ```

3. Analyze quality trends over time:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       toStartOfMinute(detected_at) as minute,
       source,
       count() as quality_events,
       sum(issue_count) as total_issues,
       sum(warning_count) as total_warnings,
       round(avg(quality_score), 3) as avg_score
   FROM data_quality
   GROUP BY minute, source
   ORDER BY minute DESC, source
   LIMIT 30;
   ```

4. Check for Solana skipped slots (consistency check):
   ```sql
   SELECT
       slot,
       parent_slot,
       slot - parent_slot - 1 as skipped_slots,
       timestamp
   FROM solana_blocks
   WHERE slot - parent_slot > 5
   ORDER BY skipped_slots DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

5. Verify Bitcoin timestamp consistency:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       block_height,
       timestamp,
       dateDiff('minute', timestamp, now()) as minutes_ago,
       CASE
           WHEN timestamp > now() THEN 'FUTURE - INVALID'
           WHEN dateDiff('hour', timestamp, now()) > 24 THEN 'VERY OLD'
           ELSE 'OK'
       END as timestamp_status
   FROM bitcoin_blocks
   ORDER BY block_height DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

**Questions to Consider:**
- What types of quality issues are most common?
- How would you alert on quality degradation?
- Why is veracity especially important for financial data like blockchain?

### Exercise 14: Extracting Value

**Learning Objectives:**
- Transform raw data into business insights
- Answer analytical questions
- Create actionable metrics

**Instructions:**

1. **Fee Analysis** - Which chain is cheaper?
   ```sql

       countIf(status = 'success') as successful,
       countIf(status = 'failed') as failed,
       round(countIf(status = 'success') * 100.0 / count(), 2) as success_rate_pct
   FROM solana_transactions
   GROUP BY hour
   ORDER BY hour DESC
   LIMIT 24;
   ```

3. **Throughput Comparison**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       chain,
       sum(tx_count) as total_transactions,
       count() as total_blocks,
       round(sum(tx_count) * 1.0 / count(), 2) as avg_tx_per_block,
       round(sum(tx_count) / dateDiff('second', min(ts), max(ts)), 2) as tx_per_second
   FROM (
       SELECT 'Bitcoin' as chain, transaction_count as tx_count, timestamp as ts
       FROM bitcoin_blocks
       UNION ALL
       SELECT 'Solana', transaction_count, timestamp
       FROM solana_blocks
   )
   GROUP BY chain;
   ```

4. **Data Pipeline ROI** - Storage efficiency value:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       table,
       sum(rows) as rows,
       formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) as would_need_uncompressed,
       formatReadableSize(sum(bytes_on_disk)) as actually_using,
       formatReadableSize(sum(bytes) - sum(bytes_on_disk)) as storage_saved,
       round((sum(bytes) - sum(bytes_on_disk)) / 1024 / 1024 * 0.023, 4) as dollars_saved_per_month
       -- AWS S3 ~$0.023/GB/month
   FROM system.parts
   WHERE database = 'blockchain_data' AND active = 1
   GROUP BY table;
   ```

**Questions to Consider:**
- What business decisions could these insights drive?
- How would you visualize these metrics for stakeholders?
- What additional value could you extract with more data?

### Exercise 15: Understanding Data Pagination

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn how pagination improves UI performance with large datasets
- Understand client-side vs server-side pagination trade-offs
- Analyze DOM rendering impact of pagination

**Instructions:**

1. **Explore the Preview Tables**
   - Open the dashboard at http://localhost:3001
   - Scroll down to the "Data Preview" section
   - Note how each table shows only 10 rows per page
   - Look for the pagination controls (Previous/Next buttons, page indicator)

2. **Navigate Through Pages**
   - Click "Next" to advance to page 2
   - Note the record counter: "Showing 11 to 20 of XX records"
   - Continue clicking "Next" until you reach the last page
   - Click "Previous" to go back

3. **Analyze Data Transfer**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
   - Refresh the page to clear network logs
   - Observe the `/api/preview/*` requests
   - Click on one request to see response size
   - Note: All 550 records are fetched once, then paginated client-side

4. **Examine Auto-Refresh Behavior**
   - Stay on page 2 or higher
   - Wait 10 seconds for data to refresh
   - Observe if you stay on the same page or get reset
   - Check the Console tab for any errors

**Questions to Answer:**

1. **How many total records are fetched for Bitcoin Transactions?**
   - Hint: Look at the table header or API response

2. **What's the advantage of client-side pagination?**
   - Think about: Speed of page switches, backend load, complexity

3. **What's the disadvantage of client-side pagination?**
   - Think about: Initial load time, memory usage, mobile performance

4. **How often does the preview data refresh?**
   - Hint: Watch the Network tab or check the page description

5. **What happens to your current page when data refreshes?**
   - Try navigating to page 3, wait 10 seconds, observe

**Extension:**

Write a query to calculate the optimal page size based on average row byte size:

```sql
SELECT
    'bitcoin_transactions' as table_name,
    avg(length(toString(tx_hash)) +
        length(toString(timestamp)) +
        8 + 8 + 4) as avg_row_bytes,
    ceil(4096 / avg_row_bytes) as optimal_page_size_for_4kb_target
FROM bitcoin_transactions
LIMIT 1000;
```

**What is pagination good for?**
- Reduces DOM nodes (only 10 rows rendered vs 550)
- Improves scroll performance
- Reduces memory usage
- Better mobile experience

### Exercise 16: Analyzing Real-Time Dashboard Performance

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand how real-time dashboards manage data updates
- Measure JavaScript execution and rendering performance
- Identify performance bottlenecks

**Instructions:**

1. **Record Performance Profile**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) → Performance tab
   - Click the record button (or Cmd/Ctrl + E)
   - Let dashboard run for 30 seconds (3 auto-refreshes at 10s intervals)
   - Stop recording
   - Chrome will generate a performance timeline

2. **Analyze the Timeline**
   - Look for repeating patterns (should see spikes every 5-10 seconds)
   - Expand the "Main" section to see JavaScript execution
   - Look for:
     - `fetch` calls (API requests)
     - React render cycles
     - DOM updates

3. **Measure Network Performance**
   - Switch to Network tab
   - Clear logs (🚫 icon)
   - Watch for 20 seconds
   - Count how many API requests occur
   - Note request timing:
     - Queue time
     - DNS lookup
     - Response time

4. **Inspect Memory Usage**
   - DevTools → Memory tab
   - Take a heap snapshot before starting collection
   - Wait 2 minutes
   - Take another heap snapshot
   - Compare the two snapshots

**Questions to Answer:**

1. **How many API requests occur per refresh cycle?**
   - Expected: 6 requests (status, data, 4x preview endpoints)

2. **What's the average response time for `/api/preview/*` endpoints?**
   - Check Network tab → Timing column
   - Should be < 100ms for small datasets

3. **How does pagination affect DOM node count?**
   - DevTools → Elements → Right-click root → Copy → Copy outerHTML length
   - Compare with and without pagination (theoretical)
   - With 550 rows: ~550 `<tr>` elements
   - With pagination (10 rows): ~10 `<tr>` elements

4. **What is SWR (stale-while-revalidate)?**
   - Research: What is the SWR pattern?
   - How does it help with real-time dashboards?
   - Check the code in `dashboard/app/hooks/usePreviewData.ts`

5. **What optimizations could reduce memory usage?**
   - Think about:
     - Virtual scrolling
     - Lazy loading
     - Server-side pagination
     - Debouncing API calls

**Performance Metrics to Record:**

| Metric | Before Pagination | After Pagination | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| DOM Nodes (approx) | ~2750 (550 rows × 5 cols) | ~50 (10 rows × 5 cols) | ~98% |
| Initial Load Time | ? ms | ? ms | ? |
| Memory Usage | ? MB | ? MB | ? |
| Scroll Performance | Laggy/Smooth? | Laggy/Smooth? | Better/Same |

**Extension Challenge:**

1. **Disable Pagination Temporarily**
   - Edit `dashboard/app/components/PreviewTable.tsx`
   - Change `ROWS_PER_PAGE = 10` to `ROWS_PER_PAGE = 550`
   - Rebuild dashboard: `docker compose build dashboard && docker compose up -d dashboard`
   - Compare performance with previous measurements

2. **Measure API Response Times**
   ```bash
   # Bitcoin Blocks (few records)
   time curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/preview/bitcoin-blocks > /dev/null

   # Solana Transactions (550 records)
   time curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/preview/solana-transactions > /dev/null
   ```

   Compare response times - larger datasets take longer!

**What did you learn?**
- Pagination dramatically reduces DOM rendering overhead
- SWR enables smart caching with auto-refresh
- Network requests are the biggest performance bottleneck
- Client-side rendering can handle moderate data volumes efficiently

## Extension Challenges

### Challenge A: Add a New Metric

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Objective:** Add a new metric to track in the collection_metrics table.

**Ideas:**
1. Track the latest block number/slot for each chain
2. Add a "blocks_behind" metric showing how far behind current chain tip
3. Track API response times separately from total collection time

**Steps:**
1. Modify the collector Python code (`collector/collectors/*.py`)
2. Update the metrics INSERT statement
3. Test the change by restarting the collector

**Hints:**
- Look at how `records_collected` is tracked
- You may need to alter the collection_metrics table schema

---

### Challenge B: Create a Custom Query

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Objective:** Write a query to answer one of these questions:

1. **Block Time Analyzer:** Calculate average time between Solana slots
2. **Fee Analyzer:** Calculate the average fee per byte for Bitcoin transactions
3. **Reliability Report:** Which blockchain has the most consistent block times?

**Example Solution (Fee Analyzer):**
```sql
SELECT
    round(avg(fee * 1.0 / size), 4) as satoshi_per_byte,
    round(avg(fee * 1.0 / weight), 4) as satoshi_per_weight_unit
FROM bitcoin_transactions
WHERE size > 0 AND weight > 0;
```

**Challenge:** Write queries for all three questions!

---

### Challenge C: Modify Collection Parameters

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Objective:** Experiment with different collection configurations.

**Instructions:**

1. Edit the `.env` file to change:
   ```bash
   # Change collection interval from 5 to 10 seconds
   COLLECTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS=10

   # Reduce safety limits for testing
   MAX_COLLECTION_TIME_MINUTES=5
   ```

2. Restart the services:
   ```bash
   docker compose down && docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Start collection and observe:
   - How does collection frequency change?
   - Does the error rate change?
   - How do the dashboard charts look different?

4. Try disabling one blockchain:
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   BITCOIN_ENABLED=false
   ```

   Observe the dashboard with only Solana enabled.

5. **Reset** to original settings when done!
